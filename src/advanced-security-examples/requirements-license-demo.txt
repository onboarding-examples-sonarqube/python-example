# Alternative requirements.txt with various license types for license checking demo
# This file demonstrates different license categories that SonarQube Advanced Security can track

# GPL Licensed packages (Copyleft - may require source disclosure)
# Note: These are example packages that may have GPL licenses in their dependency tree
matplotlib==3.5.0  # BSD-style, but may pull GPL dependencies
scipy==1.7.0       # BSD, but may have GPL components in dependency tree

# Commercial/Proprietary license examples
# (These are hypothetical - replace with actual commercial packages you want to test)
# some-commercial-package==1.0.0
